# Namespaces
- `minecraft`
> Where vanilla assets are being overwritten.
- `serider`
> Any asset that has been provided by the Serider Minigames team. This includes assets built on vanilla ones (custom variants) but excludes tweak and fixes.
- `space`
> See [Negative Space Font](https://github.com/AmberWat/NegativeSpaceFont)

**Note**: Every namespace must have its sub-folders organized in the same way as `minecraft` in order to avoid confusion.
