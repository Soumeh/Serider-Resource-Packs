## ![How To Use](how_to_use.png)

> **Already know how to use GitHub? Move to the next section.**

To upload resources to the repository, there are a few Git clients that you can use:

> - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/ "Official Website")
>   - This is the easiest tool to interract with github repositories.
> - [Tortoise Git](https://tortoisegit.org/ "Official Website")
>   - On-desktop alternative that doesn't have a GUI, for more experienced users.
> - [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Official Website")
>   - Not actually a client, but useful if you are a nerd who likes using terminals.

> *Other Git clients can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).*

To get started, create a [new fork](https://github.com/Serider-Minigames/Resource-Packs/fork) (a new version of the repository for yourself) and [clone the fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) to your computer.

## ![How To Help](how_to_help.png)

If you are uploading textures for a specific artstyle, put them in the correct path in the [`jappa`](https://github.com/Serider-Minigames/Resource-Packs/tree/main/jappa), [`classic`](https://github.com/Serider-Minigames/Resource-Packs/tree/main/classic) or other artstyle specific folders.

If you are uploading shared resources, such as translation files, sound files or any other shared resources, put them in the correct path in the [`shared`](https://github.com/Serider-Minigames/Resource-Packs/tree/main/shared") folder.

To figure out what the correct path for your files is, check the layout of the [`main`](https://github.com/Serider-Minigames/Resource-Packs/tree/main) branch, reference how [minecraft's assets](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Custom_texture_packs#Extraction) are organized, or ask Heapons or Soumeh.

After uploading your resources, make sure to [commit your changes](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project), [push the changes to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/pushing-changes-to-github) and [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request#creating-a-pull-request).

If you need any help, contact Heapons or Soumeh.
